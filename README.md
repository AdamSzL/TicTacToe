# ðŸŽ® TicTacToe App

**TicTacToe App** is a simple turn-based multiplayer game built in Java. It supports both offline play against a basic AI and real-time online matches using Firebase.  
The app was originally created as part of my learning journey into Android development, and it's built using **XML layouts** and traditional **Android Views** (without Jetpack Compose).

## âœ¨ Features

- Two game modes: **Offline vs Computer** and **Online Multiplayer**
- Simple AI opponent (randomized move selection)
- Online matchmaking with real-time game sync using **Firebase**
- Endgame result screen with "play again" option
- Realtime updates across two devices during online play
- Firebase Realtime Database used to manage players, rooms, and game state
- Custom nickname support in online mode
- Support for both victory, draw and rematch flow

## ðŸ“¦ Project Status

This was one of the first more complex Android apps I built. It helped me understand real-time data syncing, multiplayer logic, and Firebase integration.  
While I now use Jetpack Compose in most of my newer projects, this app represents an important milestone in my Android development journey.
